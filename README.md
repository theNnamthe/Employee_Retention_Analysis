# Employee_Retention_Analysis
 
An analysis on Employee Attrition


Now do some exploratory data analysis to figure out which variables have direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work)

3. Now build logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1

4. Measure the accuracy of the model
